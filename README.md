# UWP-User-Prompts-Sample
Demonstrates logic and UI to display content dialogs on important milestones: 
* first run, 
* new release,
* trial to purchase,
* rate and review.

Architecture is inspired by [Windows Template Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/windowsTemplateStudio).

Implementation is powered by [UWP Community Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit).

There is a blog post [right here](https://xamlbrewer.wordpress.com/2017/12/03/milestone-user-prompts-in-uwp/) explaining everything.
